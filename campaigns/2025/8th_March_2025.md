In the neon-lit underbelly of the city, where shadows danced with the flicker of malfunctioning streetlights, four unlikely allies found themselves bound by a common thread of survival. Aviz, a psychopath with a penchant for killing; Riz, a mercenary gang goon with an insatiable love for drugs; Glitz, a walking pincushion of piercings, perpetually glued to his RCD headset, obsessed with vampires and werewolves; and Shind, a shunned nanomancer, his body riddled with infestations from a radioactive rat bite, who sees himself as the protector of the poor. Their employer, Hiro Shade, a notorious drug lord, had them by the throat. They had stolen a significant stash of drugs from him, and now they were working off their debt. One of Hiro's lieutenants, Juhl, had been kidnapped by a rival dealer named Grime. Grime was a sleazebag of the highest order, an organ hunter, abductor, self-taught surgeon, witness for hire, and back-alley lawyer. 

Their mission: infiltrate Grime's operation, which ran out of a drug store in the sewers, and rescue Juhl. Descending into the sewers, the stench of decay and waste assaulted their senses. The dim lighting strung up by previous inhabitants cast eerie shadows on the walls. The sound of cackling echoed down the tunnel, revealing a crazed Krok Hunter throwing voltage grenades at a creature lurking beneath the sewer channel's surface—a Krok, a massive mutant crocodile-like beast.

Cautiously, they approached the scene. The Krok suddenly lunged at the Hunter, grabbing his leg. Glitz, ever the showman, offered Shind a ride on his MrN Hoverboard. As they passed the Krok, the hoverboard clipped the sewer wall, sending both Glitz and Shind tumbling to the ground. Aviz, with a sadistic grin, used his flying suit to drift towards the Krok, switching on his Cy_Sprawl Blaster. The device blared out a disturbing cacophony of sounds, rumored to be a live broadcast from a Dark God's realm of melancholy and war. The Krok went berserk, attacking Aviz, who managed to deflect the creature's maw with his foot. Riz, the trigger-happy junkie, fired off rounds from his automatic submarine guns. The bullets hit the Krok but failed to kill it. In its rage, the Krok bit off the Hunter's head. Glitz, seizing the moment, reentered the fray on his hoverboard, firing his rifle straight into the Krok's mouth and into its brain, killing it instantly in a heroic move. Taking a moment to catch their breath, the group marveled at their survival. Aviz retrieved his Cy_Sprawl blaster, now dripping with water but still functional.

They continued down the tunnel, encountering a junkie who directed them to Grime's drug store. The drug store was a confined recreational pharmacy, surprisingly clean, with chemical smells overpowering the sewer stench. Hundreds of humming refrigerators of various shapes and sizes lined the walls. Sputtering neon signs read "CANDY STORE," "FREE SAMPLES," and "NO VACANCY." Grime, the sleazebag himself, was there, covered in gang tattoos that made it impossible to identify his affiliations.

Riz engaged Grime in conversation, who offered them jobs in his drug kitchen. The overwhelming smell of chemicals and the pink and yellow fumes obscured their vision. Vents rattled as three workers and two gang goons poured bubbling liquids into stainless vats, their grins reaching from ear to ear, high on their own supply. Grime introduced them to TripWire3, the genius behind a new drug called Krok Dust. The punks started to become affected by the drug fumes, losing their sense of emotions & social inhibitions. When Grime left and TripWire3 wasn't looking, Riz pushed one of the workers into a vat. The gang goons tried to grab Riz, but he stepped out of the way and shot them both in the legs.

Hearing the commotion, Grime rushed back into the room. Shind, using his nano powers, turned one of the drug vat’s walls to dust, causing the boiling liquid to cover the gang goons, burning them to death. Grime attempted to escape through the kitchen vents, but Aviz threw two knives at him. The first hit the vent cover Grime was holding as a shield, but the second nicked an artery in his neck, causing him to collapse and quickly bleed out. Glitz then shot TripWire3 in the leg artery, spurting blood across the floor. Shind quickly created a tourniquet to stop the bleeding. They demanded to know where Juhl was being held, and TripWire3 revealed a secret door behind stainless steel crates in the room, with a keypad code "8008" to open it. 

The cyberpunks steeled themselves for the next part of their mission, ready to face whatever horrors awaited them behind that door.
