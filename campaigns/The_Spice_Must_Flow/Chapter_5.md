*“And I beheld another beast coming up out of the sand; and he had two horns like a lamb, but his mouth was fanged and fiery as the dragon, and his body shimmered and burned with great heat while it did hiss like the serpent.”* – The Orange Catholic Bible

Count Lucar Varmoth turned pages as other men might turn prayer beads. Paper and report had an economy of truth: spice production diminished through a sequence of failures; two harvesters removed from the ledger by the appetite of the desert. Houses feed on such arithmetic. The Emperor’s quota was a litmus; Varmoth’s vaults contained enough to salve immediate alarms, but not enough to buy silence from the market and CHOAM. A House that could not produce spice for the Imperium was a House stripped of future; a House without future became a story told by enemies.

Lucar did not debate the moral world. In his hands, pragmatism was a religious instrument. Clandestine expedience would buy new harvesters and crews to return production to the quotas. He saw the risk and its economy plainly: smuggle a measure of spice off Arrakis, sell it where no ledger could trace it, and buy what had to be bought. The conscience of the House was not amused, but necessity had a way of speaking louder than conscience.

He would also go into the field himself. Observation, he said, was a doctrine. Kleya, Lavro, Takshaka, Hassan, and he took a large ornithopter with Taryn Jellicoe at its controls, and four House guards under Takshaka’s eye. Departure from Arrakeen held that first, slight intoxication which comes to men when the starter of the city is left behind; in an hour, the novelty dulled into monotony. Seven hours later, the Cielago Depression opened before them: a tumbled crust of rock falling into the plain, knife-edged escarpments, and beyond them, the long, fingernail crescents of dunes marching toward a horizon where Coriolis storms churned like the planet’s bruises. Dull blotches moved on heat-ripple sands, the harvesters, half-submerged, half-alive. Vast Chrysalis Bastials marked the arrival of House Varmoth, rising like domes of living intent, luminous against the churn of weather.

The thopter settled upon the deck of the Graf Von Dreissen, also known as The Grief. The craft’s interior was a pocket universe: cramped, dingy, noisy, saturated with the sweet cinnamon of spice and the sharper tangs of grease, oil, and ozone. Jaris Obregon met them with the efficient, apologetic competence of someone perpetually in debt to circumstance. “I’m the Spice Operations Manager on the Graf Von Dreissen. It’s good to see some new faces. Come, let me show you around.” Her welcome had a practiced civility; the look in her eyes suggested that civility cost her.

Lucar answered with a House phrase both boast and creed: “We bring the thunder. Only the worthy can ride the lightning.” A saying of family and planet, it carried the weight of ritual and the ring of threat.

Obregon guided them below decks. The Grief was a machine in the half-life between care and collapse. Crew quarters crowded and untidy, the compressor a noise-box that breathed into the hull, the engine room a lit furnace of moving parts—people moved through the ship like lives conditioned to danger. Takshaka read the men as a hunter reads spoor: bruises, cuts, the architecture of beaten patience. Lavro saw machinery as a Mentat sees fact: rust, jury-rigging, and improvised solutions where proper replacement had been refused. The Grief floated by will and thrift more than by craftsmanship.

Lucar tested the gossip of men. A worker, eyes trained toward Jaris as if she were a judge of second sight, said: “We work very hard, but we are paid well for this dangerous work.” The worker’s answer had the cadence of those who have learned to keep blame where it was safe. Lucar drew Jaris aside, questioning her on the workers’ reaction, and she spoke of Globus, the carryall’s commander. “You will understand when you meet Globus; he isn’t the most competent carryall commander you’ll come across.”

Globus was the perfect bureaucratic — a man advanced by inertia, loud with the small importance of someone who has climbed only as high as his ineptitude permits. He practised blame with the ease of a craftsman. Respectful when protocol demanded and petulant with the solidity of practiced defensiveness. His self-importance found its natural end when an alarm cleared the bridge air: a scratchy comms voice announced a mechanical malfunction in the spice compressor. All compression must halt until the fault was cleared.

Globus seized the radio with a bluster that attempted to substitute for method. “Just get the spice processing up and running again as fast as possible! We can’t stand any downtime!” But Lucar was not content with slogans. He confronted the man with the raw instrument a lord must sometimes employ. “You have one minute to provide me with an explanation before I make you pay with your job or your life!” Globus’s face, red with pride, became the mask of a small animal stunned by a storm. “My… my… my life?!” he spluttered and could produce no account of competence. Takshaka had law without law: the man was marched to the mess and handcuffed to a pipe while the crew exchanged the small, savage satisfaction of those who have long known oppression.

Kleya and Lavro went to the compressor. There is a peculiar terror in a machine that continues to bear power while its safety devices lie depressed. Beneath the roar of engines, Lavro felt a thin, persistent vibration — the compressor still hummed though the emergency stop sat down like a crucifix. A worker climbed into the spice-caked machine and called: there was a creosote bush lodged in the compression plates. He reached and began to pull. When the plates moved, they drew his overalls and trapped him. Panic seized him; the machine’s teeth wanted him. Kleya used The Voice. Her words were not loud but inexorable: the man dislocated his shoulder and climbed free. His face went blank under compulsion and then returned, wet with pain and bewilderment. Such exercises of raw command are instruments of cruelty and salvation in one hand.

Lavro traced the wiring and found artifice. The emergency stop was a sham; someone had recently and deliberately rewired the system so that power continued despite the stop. The machine had been a death trap waiting for a careless touch. 

Jaris brought the maintenance log: Corinth Euler’s name was on the last entry. A mechanic whose record of insolence had marked him for demotion to the distant depot. Jaris’ words shaped a suspicion: Euler had been moved away, and his argument with Globus had been no secret. She did not say the word sabotage, but she planted the idea, her lips turning up at the corners, like one who sets seeds in good soil.

On the bridge, Hassan’s questions drew the simpler truth from men who had nothing to gain by concealment. When Globus protected his own reputation, the men suffered. “Whenever something goes wrong, Globus finds a scapegoat and beats them. If it were not for Jaris keeping the peace, I don’t know what would happen!” The pipes of responsibility led to the same treasury: fear, patched equipment, and a refusal to seek external funds for needed repairs because pride feared a request from Harkonnen coffers.

Lucar made a decisive, almost parental concession. He appointed Jaris to command the Grief’s practical operation and promised the funds she needed. She accepted on condition of support. Takshaka’s men watched the exchange and calculated the cost in the currency they knew best: lives and loyalty. Jaris confirmed what they suspected: Euler had been out of favour with Globus and now served at a distant spice depot as cold arithmetic of punishment.

The party left in their thopter toward that depot. Ten minutes into the flight, a mechanical alert bared the thinness of fortune: the engine began to die. Taryn Jellicoe, usually a professional of few words, froze with fear. Lucar moved as swiftly as the judgment of a man who knows when to take a helm. He wrested the controls from her and put down the thopter in a landing that was a rough negotiation with gravity; the craft skidded along the sand, its wings mangled, its structure crying. No life was lost, only small bodies of luck. Taryn’s sweat ran down her face, causing Takshaka to remark ominously: “Save your sweat, you will need it here”.

Takshaka, whose nature is distrust, suspected sabotage. Lavro inspected the thopter and indeed found the air intake had been deliberately clogged to attempt to cause tragedy on the House.
 
Takshaka ordered salvage from the wreck: water, rations, a medical kit. They were not long in collecting their needs before the desert answered them with an old tongue: a crest of sand on the horizon, rising like a tomb’s lid — a sandworm had smelled the impact.

The escape to a rocky outcrop became an exercise in the arithmetic of distance. Lavro, Kleya, Lucar, Hassan, and the guards made it quickly and without trouble; Hassan tore his stillsuit on the climb and cursed into the wind. Takshaka and Taryn lagged, ankles and breath bargaining for each step. They reached the outcrop as the worm breached the sand in a monstrous eruption. The creature’s maw was a ring of grinding plates, white and infinite; the sound was not so much heard as felt — sand and metal and fate being rearranged. The thopter vanished, swallowed into the worm’s appetite. Takshaka watched metal disappear with the complex expression of a man who had taken pride and paid it a price. The scene was not melodrama but unpitying fact.

They rested. Takshaka and Taryn were exhausted. Lavro patched Hassan’s stillsuit and then climbed to a vantage to try the radio. Coriolis storms smoked along the horizon; their interference tore speech into static. No contact could be maintained.

They moved from outcrop to outcrop with the desert’s indifference in their ears. Suddenly they were surrounded by Fremen like a tide enclosing a reef. Even Takshaka had not seen them approach. Drasil, their chief, spoke with the small pride of one who balances curiosity with caution. He demanded identity; he suspected Harkonnen guile. Lucar revealed his face — hair full, not shorn as a Harkonnen might keep — and that simple proof shifted suspicion into curiosity. Takshaka answered with House creed: “Our people harvest the storms!” Drasil’s approval was not eloquent but real. A gift sealed the small contract: Takshaka offered an heirloom sword, heavy with lineage. The Fremen performed their ceremony of friendship: water exchanged, oaths murmured. House Varmoth acquired desert allies by a barter older than commerce.

The Fremen led them close enough to make contact with worm sign spotters, and Lavro negotiated for a pickup. The pilots feared leading harvesters vulnerable to worms; Lavro’s compromise — have the carryall lift the harvesters to safety while spotters fetch the Varmoth party — was an adroit movement of balance and responsibility. The party was transported to the harvester Alberich, a desert ship that had refused to cease its work. It offered shelter not of comfort but of effective habit.

A hatch spat out Metzos, the Alberich’s skipper — large, crass, and unapologetically direct. “We’ve got a job to do here. We can’t stop operations just to pick up idiots who can’t keep their thopter up in the air!” Count Lucar announced himself, and Metzos hauled them aboard with the rough kindness of a crew used to being hauled by necessity. The harvester smelled of spice and labour: louder, filthier than the Grief but better maintained.

Lavro’s eye found a mark of ownership on cases of spice: a crudely sprayed wheatsheaf — the sigil of House Alexin. Suspicion threaded tighter. Lavro also noticed the words “Corinth Euler” embossed on one of the worker's overalls and pointed them out to Hassan. Hassan questioned Euler and discovered a contradiction: Jaris had reassigned him to the Alberich and not the spice depot. Metzos, pragmatic and unsentimental, told them Euler was a good mechanic and had been fixing problems since his arrival.

Suddenly a thopter arrived; it was Jaris. Kleya’s Bene Gesserit inspection was surgical. She asked Jaris who funded her work; the name Varerius Industries came with the practiced comfort of a contracted lie. Kleya pressed: “Are you sure that you don’t work for House Alexin?” Jaris did not know Alexin; Kleya’s inner craft detected that the woman guarded something she did not understand. The pressure turned Jaris fragile; she broke with a sound like a reed and wept. She pleaded to Metzos for help and payment for the crew. Metzos, who had already watched men die to sand, refused sympathy for weakness.

Hassan’s blade at Jaris’ throat performed that grim economic function that threat often does: expediency. Under the point of metal, Jaris confessed. It had been easy — the Grief’s state and Globus’ eagerness to blame made sabotage a small art. The confession was not theatrical; it was pragmatic. 

Then the radio bore a voice that took the colour from the room: worm sign. A great sandworm would reach Alberich in fifteen to twenty minutes. Operators quickly contacted The Grief and requested a pick-up, but the response was devastating; they had more problems and could not come for at least an hour.

Panic is a mathematical force. The crews pushed for survival: thopters, seats, flight. But three worm sign spotters and Jaris’ thopter offered only ten spare seats. Sacrifice hovered as practical arithmetic. Takshaka placed his hand on Manu’s shoulder and spoke the soldier’s words: Manu had done his duty; he would die with honour. They saluted — a private ritual where courage and loss meet.

Metzos tried to drive the harvester onto flat rock to save lives and spice, but the worm was already present in the sand and the Alberich was devoured. Manu, Euler, Metzos and the crew vanished into the old planet ritual; Takshaka watched with the odd compound of sorrow and pride reserved for those who had lost many men. There was no heroism in the crunch of metal, only the inevitability of old rules. 

House Varmoth returned to Arrakeen hollow and sharp, taught by the desert that the price of survival is sometimes paid in names and bones.

The next day the domestic mechanisms of power took over. Lundrak Varmint, House spymaster, worked with Verite serum — the terrible clarifier — on Jaris. Under its influence she unknotted a story of payment and motive. House Vertas, she said, had contracted her. They had expected more spice share from Arrakis and had been affronted when the rights went to a house they judged insignificant. The actor named Rovan Vertas — young, ambitious, desirous of a mark to prove himself to Duke Damar Vertas — appeared in her account as the likely architect. Whether the Duke sanctioned the action was left uncertain; the fog of plausible deniability had its own utility. Payments had come through a dead drop in Arrakeen and were small, precise bribes designed to wreck The Grief in ways that would find Globus the natural scapegoat.

There are finalities at the edges of such revelations. Houses trade in influence and sanctions, in contracts and the geometry of silence. Lucar’s plan to smuggle became a necessity sharpened by treachery; the House must recover spice production and reputation, and they must do so against a horizon of deliberate opposition. Kleya’s voice remained a low, constant measure: the search for hidden knowledge is a moth’s business — delicate, drawn to light that can scorch. Lavro catalogued facts and probabilities into a lattice of future action. Takshaka prepared men who had seen the sea of sand eat their brother and would move differently now. Hassan kept the small metal of knives close and the larger metal of loyalty closer. Lucar, who wished to prove himself, had learned the desert’s cruelty: the scent of spice is not always sweet, enemies conspire where scarcity bites, incompetence can be weaponised but in the end the desert will always take its tithe.
