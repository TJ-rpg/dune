*"My father once told me that respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. 'Something cannot emerge from nothing,' he said. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable 'the truth' can be."* – Princess Irulan

Lady Kleya sat with her hands folded like a moth’s wings, listening to the small, uncompromising voice that was her certainty. She turned the meeting over in her mind as if one might turn a bone to see its marrow: Romesha Cotto had been nervous, yes — and yet nothing in him smelled of a lie. He needed the carryall taken to Carthag post haste. He had asked for protection in the idiom of merchants: urgency and plausible danger. Kleya, trained in the Bene Gesserit arts of tone and nuance, read the tremor in the merchant’s caution as truth.

Dali Tarek Nivahn smelled opportunity in the wet trace of that urgency. A smuggler’s unwritten contract had been freshly inked. He tasted a future where the Varmoth name carved itself deeper into Arrakeen’s underbelly, usurping control from House Harkonnen. If water could be used as currency, why not as a weapon?

Count Lucar carried his hatred like a ceremonial cloak. The man had met Eques Farzan — an amenable clerk who tilled numbers rather than men — and yet the old images in Lucar’s mind remained: Nos Nosferatu, the bald spectre of a childhood fear. A memory is a small thing until duty presses upon it and makes of that smallness a blade. He would not be unsteady. The future of House Varmoth sat on his shoulders; on those shoulders he placed a smile like a weapon.

Hassan Diago, obedient as a shadow to the Count, took his place in two offices at once: steward of the house’s bearing and spider in the merchant web. He believed his path lay in quiet service that would be rewarded with significance. He contrived the lure: move the carryall with little visible escort and make it an inviting target for bandits — let the predators believe the prize came naked. 

Lucar and Hassan would sit within the carryall. Dali would fly the ornithopter — Kleya and Lavro in his wake — with seven house soldiers, their wings watching for treachery.

Romesha Cotto met them at the Arrakeen Spaceport, a man whose sweat was an insult to the water shortages of Arrakeen. He showed them the carryall: a great, throbbing belly of metal and sealant, smelling faintly of machine oil and spice residue. They pressed him to accompany them on the journey, but Cotto would not leave Arrakeen. Instead, he sent an envoy, Layle Nasim, whose posture reassured while his eyes told of caution. He promised that Miran Rocha would be waiting for them at Carthag.

The two craft climbed the hot columns of Arrakis air. The ornithopter’s wings beat a living rhythm as the desert rose to meet them: a seething, heat-bent ocean of gold and the slow red light of the dying sun. Carthag unfolded ahead — black, industrial, bearing Harkonnen banners that sought to make the very sky theirs. On approach, the air traffic tower’s voice snapped — who are you, what cargo? — and the carryall was directed toward hangar D42, the thopter to a small pad near control. Protocols and paper made themselves teeth.

Lucar and Hassan disembarked and were received by Miran Rocha, sleek as a market serpent and as safe to trust as any Harkonnen coin. She signalled a man to inspect the water. Lucar asked: why did Cotto not come? Rocha’s smirk answered in one word: cowardliness. Hassan stepped aside, radio crackling, and took Cotto’s voice away from Rocha’s ears. Cotto honoured the deal— in return for their help, he would tell them what he knew: a gang led by a man called Bodelli had offered him discounted water — his suspicion, it was from the stolen carryall— and when he refused, Bodelli’s men threatened him. He had not wanted to go to the Harkonnens; their retribution would not be merciful. Rocha’s guards shifted; the air thickened with the odor of knives. Hassan judged the moment perilous and guided the party away.

In his local bar, Hassan found Calman, a grey-market dealer whose loyalty was measured in cold, hard Solaris. In a backroom hidden behind a hanging carpet, Calman told what he knew: the Boselli gang could be seen where Harkonnens go to enjoy themselves — the Eastern Wasteland. He suspected the Boselli base lay on the route to Arrakeen, and Boselli had only recently moved to the business of hijacking water carryalls.

While Hassan whispered with Calman, Dali watched. He saw a man whose face refused to stay itself: a Cibus Hood — an Ixian malleable mask that erased features and left no energy reading — an altered face at each glance, making any man both many and no one. Dali’s eyes tracked the mask, his instincts tightening like a bowstring. The hooded figure bolted for the door; Lucar was faster. He tackled the man, tore the hood away, and revealed a scarred cheek — the man who had accompanied Cotto at the House Seraut party.

Lucar pressed his blade to the man’s throat and drew blood, a threat sharpened by ceremony. The man smiled, unshriven. Lucar took the Cibus Hood for himself and called Takshka to have House soldiers take the man back to Arrakeen by ornithopter for spymaster Lundrak Varmint to interrogate.

Lundrak’s methods were simple and final: a Verite serum, a needle into the conscience. The man immediately declared his name was Deimos and he unlatched his life in a rush: he owed his life to Romesha Cotto, who had bought him from a slaver at seven. Cotto raised him and made him useful — a water-seller, then a man who learned to protect Cotto’s interests. Cotto, Deimos confessed, had bought water from Boselli and was now trying to eradicate his treachery through Boselli’s death and ensure his own protection. Deimos had trailed the Varmoth party to learn where the Boselli gang was located. The confession fit like a stolen glove: Cotto feared Boselli would turn on him and expose Cotto’s split chain and effort to take advantage of increased water prices due to shortages.

While this unspooling occurred, Lavro did what Mentats do: he entered the bureaucracy like a knife enters slig meat. He infiltrated the spaceport administration and traced the missing carryalls to duty rosters. One name drew his attention — Adavir Toth — on duty when several carryalls vanished. Toth would be on duty the next day. The pattern suggested not random theft but a human pivot: a man in the wheelhouse of port schedules.

Night and barter brought the party to the Eastern Wasteland. Dali, ever the opportunist, bought attention with coin. A guard watched them with the intense habit of those used to being paid. Dali loosened his purse and the guard’s mouth. Two members of the Boselli crew were inside. Lucar approached them and laid a simple lie that smelled of opportunity: he represented a Major House, had Solaris to offer for water, and could keep their burdens from Harkonnen notice if they sold to him. He bought them spice beer, saw their guard drop, and offered a proposition — weapons and cover in exchange for regular water at a reasonable cost. The men, small-time and hungry for leverage, promised to pass on the offer to Boselli.

The next day, the gang sent word: Boselli would meet, but the party must be blindfolded for transport to their base. Lucar refused such an obscuring ritual. A Count could not be blindfolded and led; he would not practice humility that simulated fear. Instead, they agreed on neutral ground in the desert — twenty-five kilometres from Carthag — a place of wind and open sight.

They flew. The ornithopter hunched through the hot, dusty air; the desert around them held no witness except the sun. Boselli and his men were waiting at the meeting place, lasguns propped like religious talismans. Hassan introduced the Count with much ceremony: “Count Lucar, Head of House Varmoth, first of his name and rider of lightning.” Boselli blinked, uncertain whether this was being said in jest or a declaration of authority. Lucar’s speech was plain: Varmoth money and muscle to launder stolen water, to find legal markets, to protect Boselli from Harkonnen reprisals. House Varmoth would supply arms and supplies if Boselli would sell water at a steady price. It was the old bargain: legitimacy in exchange for contraband.

Boselli agreed. As hands were shaken, an ornithopter bearing Harkonnen insignia passed above like a vulture. Boselli’s finger twitched, and a lasgun spoke — a clean, terrible cut through metal — and the Harkonnen craft went down. The sky took its own testimony: a falling machine, a plume, and silence. Whether the downed pilot had time to send a warning remained unknown. The desert keeps its secrets with the patient cruelty of sand.

Lucar’s mind, always moving, set its teeth to another plan. He would not merely ally with Boselli; he would bend the merchant Cotto to a new usefulness. Blackmail was a blunt tool but effective. He would tell the Harkonnens that Cotto had stolen their water — or make them believe it — unless Cotto hired another gang to steal a carryall that House Varmoth would then appear to retrieve and deliver, evidence in hand, to Eques Farzan. In Farzan’s ledger and conscience, the culprits would be the second gang; Cotto’s guilt would remain hidden. The Varmoths would repair their finances — and their honour — with a theft that paid itself.

The immediate fruit of this dubious justice: House Varmoth now possessed a supply of water. They did what nobility in a dry land are meant to do and gave a little away. Arrakeen’s people drank and murmured; the Varmoth name warmed a few parched mouths. Charity, said Lucar inwardly, is often a soft blade. One gives a loaf and keeps the recipe for the oven.

In small theatres of power, the new alliances settled like a new skin. Boselli had an ally; Varmoth had an instrument; Cotto had only fear.

It was not a triumph of purity. Their justice had the stink of contrivance. Yet in the arithmetic of power, water is a necessity, and necessity breeds obedience. House Varmoth had bought itself leverage. They would use stolen water to pay the Harkonnen water fai
— a perverse balance that left the Harkonnens paid by the very cargo they guarded; House Varmoth would, in secret, be the channel of that tribute. The future of Arrakeen’s water economy looked different by one small margin: those who controlled the flow would control the people’s tongues.

And as with all measures taken on Arrakis, the consequences would outlive the men who invented them. A gullible person might think this is justice. A careful person — a Count, a Bene Gesserit, a Mentat — knew that justice on Arrakis is dealt out by those who control the machine; it makes cogs of men who will later pledge their loyalty.

They had not toppled the Harkonnens. No one ever did so in a single day. But they had begun to rearrange the desert’s scales. In a world of drought, even a single added drop can drown a lord.
