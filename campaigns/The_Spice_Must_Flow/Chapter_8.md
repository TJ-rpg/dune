*“The lone traveller in the desert is a dead man. Only the worm lives alone out there.”* - Fremen Saying

Lucar had received a small, dark wing of trust from Drasil of Sietch Korba: a Distrans bat, a token cut from the very custom of desert men. It meant more than friendship. It meant that Drasil felt the pressure of claws at his throat and wanted help. Lucar’s blood answered the call before his reason did. To fight the Harkonnens was a pleasure he would not deny himself; to prove he was not foolish would be a pleasure he would not forego.

Lavro’s mind, neat as a ledger, tabulated the gift differently. He saw windows of knowledge in the Sietch: stillsuitcraft, water conservation, desert engineering. He would trade data for practice, and the desert could be taught to him if he wished. 

Hassan, who lived in the spaces between public face and private truth, saw profit in a different currency. “We can become arms suppliers to every party on Arrakis,” he mused to Lucar in the small of the ornithopter’s hull, “and we make the Harkonnens bleed for every drop they think they own.” Lucar smiled.

They took two House guards, as modest prudence demanded. The flight west over the Cielago Depression made the skin of the world seem thin and brittle — the spice operations like small wounds. Far below a rendezvous point lay hidden, and as they neared Lucar’s eyes found a scene of violence: an ornithopter grounded, men locked in savage struggle, lasgun flares like the small, violent stars of fate. Before they could clarify friend from foe, a missile fired toward them. Lucar, quick in instinct, wrenched the controls. The ornithopter dove and landed in the sand with a shock like sudden truth. No blood spilled; luck and skill dressed them in its thin favour.

Lavro cautioned against using personal shields — it sang to sandworms like a bell to a beast — but Lucar turned his shield on anyway. On the sand, they mounted oil-lens binoculars and studied. Harkonnen soldiers and Fremen had fought to a residue of corpses. Lucar sent the guards forward; he, Lavro, and Hassan hung back.

The guards returned with the tale writ in the sand: dozens of Harkonnens and Fremen dead, but two Fremen renegades remained alive. A woman knelt by a wounded man; the woman waved them over. The man protested weakly — Torben — while the woman’s voice, clipped and urgent, ordered him to accept aid. Hassan, efficient and practical, salvaged a Harkonnen medikit and a sword. Lavro, in his zeal for assistance, misapplied a treatment and made Torben scream. 

The woman introduced herself as Tyra; the wounded man was her brother. Torben did not want to reveal the Sietch’s location. The Fremen code is a lattice of secrecy and survival; outsiders are useful only when they are blindfolded and bound. They offered ropes and blindfolds and accepted the terms. Before they left, Tyra insisted they learn to walk without rhythm — a movement against the worm’s hearing — and Lucar, who learned quickly as men learn in battle, moved with the slow, careful cadence of the desert-born. As they looked back from the rocks, the black bellies of fate took Lucar’s shield for their singing: their ornithopter vanished into a maw; a sandworm had fed as the shield called its appetite.

Lavro memorised the path with every sense but sight, as the young mentat was taught to do. The desert provided its lessons and its silence. The party made their slow, tethered approach to Sietch Korba. Torben’s wound was grave but not fatal. Children of the sietch crowded with fearless curiosity at these off-worlders with wrong-coloured eyes and stillsuits that smelled of metal and city. A Fremen warrior approached; Lucar spat on the sand before the man — an old sign of respect. The man returned the gesture; the tribe’s tension tightened like a drawn skin.

Drasil arrived and made the laughter of a man who keeps storms in and does not let them go free. He spoke of trust and trial. The party gave up their weapons quietly, a concession that read as weakness to the watching warriors. Drasil took them to his private council quarters — simple, woven, doors of heavy plant-hangings in place of doors — and then the meeting began.

“Build trust in the next few days,” Drasil said. “Sietch Korba needs more than words; we need deeds. The Harkonnens have sharpened their teeth against us and blame us for water carryall attacks we did not commit. We fight for our children, but we need allies.”

Lucar’s voice carried like an arrow. “House Varmoth and I, personally, have suffered under the Harkonnens. I have drawn Harkonnen blood and I am willing to lend my sword to Sietch Korba, if you increase your brutality against the Harkonnens and also disrupt their spice mining.”

Drasil’s gaze narrowed; his diplomacy wrapped the answer in patience. “Any help House Varmoth can provide will be welcome. Water is precious beyond coin; weapons and information are welcome as well. But you must understand—trust is slow.”

Lucar leaned forward. “You have stealth and anonymity. We can provide water, weapons, and intelligence. Together you can strike where the Harkonnens sleep.”

Drasil lifted a hand. “Support from other sietches requires proof. Sietch-to-sietch trust is old and wary. Start here, with Korba. Build trust with action.”

Hassan, practical and blunt, interjected: “The more Harkonnen blood spilled, the more weapons and water can be supplied. Trade in action.”

Drasil’s face registered neither horror nor delight — only absorption. “My concern is stopping Harkonnen attacks. If you can make them think twice, if you can cut their advantage, that will be welcome.”

Lucar let a smile cross his features, a smile that contained a blade. “I’m willing to share a little blood in order to ensure the Harkonnens are bled dry! I can make Sietch Korba more than just a mosquito — I can make you a Death Moth! This is your world. House Varmoth was sent here by another offworlder — the Emperor — who controls the galaxy. We are under his heel and the Harkonnens are the tip of that heel. If you help us against the Harkonnens, we will help you survive.”

Drasil considered the phrase and the man. “I agree, but numbers matter, we are but one Sietch,” he said finally.

They agreed to a plan: water and weapons would be dropped near the Cielago Depression at a cache the Varmoth miners used. Supply lines that ran past Harkonnen eyes would disguise the gift. Drasil’s voice grew softer in conclusion. “You have convinced me. Now gain the trust of my people.”

Drasil called for Tyra and she led them to the sietch sleeping quarters, then to where evening food was served: grain tonged with spice. The PCs noticed the spice was liberally distributed to all but them; Fremen culture reserves the highest rites for its own first. Hassan watched that nothing was wasted; Fremen efficiency is a religion.

Morning came early. The sietch awoke and joined the practical religion of cleanliness. As Lucar swept sand and learned modesty, when a passing warrior kicked the sand he had gathered, Lucar’s temper, hot and precise, flared. Nulan, a lean veteran whose life had been carved by Harkonnen cruelty, denied any slight; words became heat and the heat became uncontrollable fire. A duel was demanded.

Knives flashed in ring-light; the sietch hushed to the rush of fate. Nulan’s crysknife gleamed like an old promise. The duel that followed was not a contest of fury alone but of control. Nulan struck true for honour and remembered grief; Lucar fought with the calm of a man who knew exactly what he would do. Nulan could not land a blow that mattered; Lucar’s blade found pulse and flesh thrice, each blow a precise argument. When Nulan lay forced to the sand, Lucar held his knife to the throat and—beyond the measure of his intent—cut an artery. The blood whooped like a sudden bell. Nulan bled out while warriors moved not to save but to gather the sacred blood. Lucar, with hands that did not tremble, wiped his blade and dripped the blood into a flask — a ritual trophy, the sign of a life given as proof.

After that, the sietch stirred into a different rhythm. Bright fabrics came from chests; the community prepared for the most private of rites. Tyra explained the Water of Life ceremony: a Sayyadina would drink the raw poison and transform it; the drinking would be communal, ecstatic, a sharing of memory and destiny. 

That evening, they were taken to a sacred room where the Fremen gathered in plain garments and sat on woven prayer-mats. The Sayyadina recited the sietch’s history, the litany of their migrations, and the names that bound them. The story closed with a prayer for the Lisan al-Gaib, the coming of a messianic voice.

The Sayyadina drank the Water of Life and convulsed as poison and ritual contended. For almost an hour she writhed; then she regurgitated the altered potion until it blended with the rest and became safe for the sietch. One by one, the Fremen dabbed the water to their lips. Hassan offered to drink first — an act of symbolic servitude and trust — but Lucar insisted that he be first, an act of complete trust. Lavro next almost leapt to follow. Hassan hesitated at the last heartbeat, then drank. The narcotic’s tide came on them like a soft wave: visions, unity, the loose-joined singing that made bodies and memories braid into a single knot. Where they had been strangers, the Varmoth men found themselves part of a larger rhythm. Night became an animal that ate propriety.

Dawn after the ceremony was a muted light. Tyra awakened them early and gave them Fremen stillsuits — tight and dead to city air — and peculiar hooks and rope. They were flown by an ornithopter to the silent sand where the test would be administered. Sietch watchers perched on the high ridges; the party was to survive alone for a span while observed. It was a trial of common sense and desert craft.

They walked without rhythm, using Lavro’s memorised sense of direction, when a Fremen ran past to plant a thumper. Wormsign appeared. The tremor moved underfoot and the desert birthed a great, terrible mouth. Hassan ran with the panic of a man who has seen enough to know his fear. Lavro froze as thought hardened into petrified awe. The Fremen who had planted the thumper ran forward. Lucar, without hesitation, followed him like a shadow. The Fremen leapt upon the worm’s side, sinking wormhooks biting into the skin. Lucar also jumped, throwing his own hooks into the lip of a moving world. The moment the worm rolled and turned beneath them, Lucar felt exhilaration akin to the first time he had ridden a giant moth: a violent, pure joy at mastering a wild thing.

The wormrider who rode with him, Straiz, spoke over the roar. In that high, wind-cleansed conversation, a bond was struck: two men on the back of a beast, one born to the sand, one an off-worlder who would not give in to fear. The ride became legend in a single breath; Lucar rode like a god, and the sietch saw in him a man who could take the desert’s wildness and make it an ally.

Lavro and Hassan staggered back to the sietch, and there, on the crest of a dune, Lavro spotted a man near an enclosed planting and windtraps — a stranger with Arrakeen blue-in-blue eyes and a stillsuit fashioned in Arrakeen style. The Fremen took him swiftly. Under pressure, he named himself Jarood and claimed affiliation with the Spacing Guild; his craft had gone down nearby, and he had come to inspect the Cielago Depression. He refused to speak further.

Lucar returned from the ride to Drasil’s embrace. A plan formed regarding Jarood. He would send Lundrak Varmint — House Varmoth’s spymaster — to interrogate Jarood with verite serum. The Fremen demanded that Jarood not leave without losing his water; Hassan agreed with grim good humour.

Drasil pledged House Varmoth the loyalty of Sietch Korba and, with gravity and a rare lift of optimism, offered two thousand Fedaykin to the Varmoth cause. He would bring the proposal to the Fremen council. They celebrated with the simplicity of desert men: song and bread, and a bottle of Caladonian wine from Hassan’s careful stores poured for Drasil. For one night the Fremen shared wine and off-world laughter and the sietch’s old fires listened. The sietch celebrated, the Varmoth men drank and the ledger of alliances thickened.

House Varmoth returned to Arrakeen in Jarood’s ornithopter. Lundrak left for the sietch at their request and, with the cold politeness of a man who kept facts like bees in jars, administered verite. Before the Fremen and the curious, Jarood’s voice uncoiled under the serum. He confessed what he had been hunting: he believed the sietch to be behind attempts to make Arrakis green — plantings, hidden water caches, engineering that might change the ecology. He linked water and worms in a fearful equation: water upsets the worms; worms make spice; the spice stream could be disturbed by folly. He had contacts within the Guild and was trying to stop an ecological change that, in his mind, threatened all the trade in spice.

Jarood’s words were blunt and full of the fears of small men who imagine they hold the world in their hands. The truth he offered had the shape of a question more than an answer: had Sietch Korba become a seedbed for a new Arrakis? Was the Cielago Depression’s failing harvest tied to changes in water and worm patterns? The answers mattered.

When the chronicle of the night was later reduced to steps and plans, House Varmoth counted gains: a pledge of two thousand Fedaykin, caches of water and arms placed in secret, new knowledge of Guild worry, and a ritual bond made with the desert’s children. They had given blood — Nulan’s — and taken a promise. In exchange, they had the sietch’s ears and their bones’ respect. The desert had given them a ride on a worm and taken their ornithopter. The arithmetic of thirst had shifted by a fraction, enough to open new strategies.

Lucar’s mind had already turned to calculation. Lavro’s ledger filled with new facts. Hassan rubbed his hands and imagined new markets for weapons. Lundrak was already shaping the questions he would ask of the Guild channels. The sietch would test them further; the Harkonnens would not be idle. The desert, with its slow patience and sudden appetite, kept its long view.

The sietch would watch. The Harkonnens would move. The Guild would whisper. Meanwhile, men drank and counted and planned. In the calculus of Arrakis, that is often enough to begin a change.
