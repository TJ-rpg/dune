The original source of wealth and influence for House Alexin stems from a humble gourd native to their home world Keres. The gourd has a unique property of not decaying and being viable for a decade or longer. Once the gourd is boiled in water it becomes fleshy and edible. It can also be processed into breads and textured protein to be used in many food preparations. Due to the longevity of this food without need of refrigeration or other preserving methods, it’s a popular ration among the Imperium’s military forces and other places without abundant resources.  

As such, House Alexin has specialized in industrial agriculture and food production and been rewarded with immense wealth. The wealth gained from this source has allowed them to expand into transportation and logistics. Currently, they occupy multiple agricultural worlds and serve as a primary food supplier to the Imperium. The vast resources at their command also allow them to field an impressive defensive military. As a powerful House, they are often courted by many other factions as an ally.

The House banner is a wheatsheaf on a harvest yellow background. It has been a source of derision at times, but the House founder intended it to be a reminder for his descendants of their humble origins. Many of the regal portraits hanging in the palace of the ruling line show them posing with some sort of farm produce held proudly in hand.
