# **Talents**  

## **OTHER MEMORY (BENE GESSERIT TALENT)**  
*You have undergone the Agony attended by another
Reverend Mother, and now you can draw upon the memories and wisdom of all your ancestors. In doing so, you
have become a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit.*  

You must be a Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit
(and have an appropriate trait reflecting this) to select
this talent. If this talent is selected in play, another Reverend Mother must be on hand and in physical contact
to pass this genetic memory on to you.  

Whenever you attempt a test where knowledge of past
events—even those which may have occurred many
generations ago—would be beneficial, you score three
automatic successes. You may also share your genetic
memory with other Reverend Mothers at will.  

## **PRANA-BINDU CONDITIONING (BENE GESSERIT TALENT)**  
*You have absolute control over your body. Every muscle
and every nerve is under your control, and you have even
mastered your own body chemistry and metabolism.*  

Whenever you attempt a Move or Discipline test which
relies on your control of your body, you may re-roll a
single d20. You can perfectly control your breathing,
heart rate, and your internal organs (including the ability
to choose whether to conceive a child, and to determine the child’s physical and genetic traits).  

## **VOICE (BENE GESSERIT TALENT)**  
*You have been trained to modulate your voice to influence the subconscious minds of others. With this skill
you can subtly manipulate others, alter motivations and
moods, or even compel action from the unwilling.*  

You may use Voice whenever you speak to someone
else, though you must be able to observe them for a
short while beforehand, and they must be able to hear
you speak. When you use Voice, you may add one, two,
or three points to Threat to score the same number of
automatic successes on any Communicate test made to
influence your chosen target. The greater the number of
automatic successes, the more overt your use of Voice,
which others may notice. Your training also allows you
to buy those automatic successes on any test made to
resist the effects of Voice.
