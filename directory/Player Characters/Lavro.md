## **INTENSE STUDY**

a single skill test instead of any other skill, and you are
counted as having a focus for that test.

developed your intellect into a potent and valuable
thing. You can retain and process vast amounts of information at extraordinary speeds.*

to recalling data, one of the D20s in your pool may be
considered to have rolled a 1 instead of rolling it.

*You have so much data at your fingertips you can see
where it contradicts and determine where falsehoods lie.*  

You may spend a point of Momentum to ask the gamemaster if a piece of information you have is true or
false. You need not be making a skill test as with Obtain
Information, and the data can be your supposition as
much as a specific document or rumour.
