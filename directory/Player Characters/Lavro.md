developed your intellect into a potent and valuable

where it contradicts and determine where falsehoods lie.*  

You may spend a point of Momentum to ask the gamemaster if a piece of information you have is true or
false. You need not be making a skill test as with Obtain
Information, and the data can be your supposition as
much as a specific document or rumour.
